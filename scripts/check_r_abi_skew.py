"""Assert that the R binding can link against the C ABI its version names.

Every other binding ships its native code in the same artifact as its wrapper,
so the two can never disagree. R is the exception: `bindings/r/configure`
downloads a prebuilt `wickra-benchmark-c-<triple>.tar.gz` from the GitHub release
named by `DESCRIPTION: Version`, and compiles `src/wickra_benchmark.c` against it.
The wrapper comes from the working tree; the ABI comes from a published release.

Our own CI never sees that pairing: the R job sets `WKBENCH_INC` / `WKBENCH_LIB` and
builds against the header and library in the tree, which match by construction.
r-universe does see it, and the sibling indicator repository learned what that
costs -- its registry went red for days over 177 symbols the wrapper called that
the last release did not ship, and one export that had gained a parameter. The
skew was not a defect there and would not be one here: the wrapper is correct
against the ABI in the tree, and a release republishes both together. It is
simply invisible until a registry reports it. This makes it visible in the pull
request that opens it.

Two claims, only one of them blocking:

  * Every `wickra_benchmark_*` symbol the wrapper calls must exist, with the same
    signature, in the header in this tree. A violation means the wrapper is
    stale, which is a defect and fails.
  * The same, against the header at the tag `DESCRIPTION: Version` names. A
    violation means main is ahead of the last release. The registry tracks
    `*release`, so r-universe goes on serving the previous one rather than
    failing on this one -- which makes this a release-readiness signal, not a
    defect, so it warns.

Nothing has been released yet, so the second check finds no tag and says so. It
starts doing work the moment the first one exists.
