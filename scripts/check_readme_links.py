"""Binding READMEs must not use repository-relative links.

Each `bindings/*/README.md` is, or is one workflow line away from being, the long
description of a published package: PyPI renders the Python one, NuGet the C#
one, pkg.go.dev the Go one, r-universe the R one. A link like
`../../docs/COOKBOOK.md` resolves on GitHub and nowhere else -- on a registry page
it is simply broken, and nothing in the build says so, because the file it points
at does exist in the repository.

So the rule is: anything that ships as package metadata links absolutely. The
repository's own README is exempt and deliberately keeps relative links -- it is
read on GitHub far more than anywhere else, and that is the convention the main
wickra repository uses too.

Run from the repository root:  python scripts/check_readme_links.py
